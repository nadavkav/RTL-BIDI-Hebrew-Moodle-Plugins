<h1>ForumNG</h1>

<h2>Recent items in feeds</h2>

<p>
Feeds include a certain number of items, starting from the most recent. As
new posts arrive on the forum, older items are discarded from feeds. 
</p>

<p>
Because feeds work by software checking them occasionally, items might be
skipped altogether if there are very many posts to a forum and the number of 
recent items is low. Conversely, if the number of items is very high, users who
initially sign up to a feed will see a large number of irrelevant messages,
and the demand on the server will also increase. 
</p>

<p>
This option can be disabled at site level in the system settings. If the option
is fixed in system settings, then all forums receive the same setting. If the
option is not fixed, then it can be changed on each individual forum.
