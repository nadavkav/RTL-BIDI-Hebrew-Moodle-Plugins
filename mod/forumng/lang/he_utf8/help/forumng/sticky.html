<h2>Sticky discussion</h2>

<p>
If you choose <strong>Discussion stays on top of list</strong> then,
perhaps unsurprisingly, the discussion stays on top of the discussion list.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Sticky discussions have an up-arrow icon. A divider bar separates
sticky and normal discussions.</li>
<li>You can have more than one sticky discussion in a forum. If there are
multiple discussions, they are sorted in the normal order (newest first). There
is no way to control the order.</li>
<li>If a user changes the sort order, sticky discussions remain on top. The
sticky discussions themselves will be sorted by the selected order, but all 
of them will appear above all normal discussions.</li>
</ul>
