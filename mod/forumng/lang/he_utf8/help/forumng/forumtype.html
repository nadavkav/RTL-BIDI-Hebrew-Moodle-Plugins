<h1>ForumNG</h1>

<h2>Forum type</h2>

<p>
Different types of forum may be available for specific purposes or teaching
methods.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Standard forum for general use</strong> &ndash;
A normal forum in which students can freely participate.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Study advice (only see own discussions)</strong> &ndash;
Students can only see discussions they started themselves. Within those
discussions, they can read and reply freely.</p>
<p>This type of forum can be set up for students to request study advice from 
an advisor. (Those giving the advice must have the 
<tt>mod/forumng:viewallposts</tt> capability so that they can view other 
people's discussions.)</p> 
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that standard capability overrides can be used to restrict permissions
more generally (for example if you want a forum that students cannot post to).
