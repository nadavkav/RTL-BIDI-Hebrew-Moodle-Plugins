<h1>ForumNG</h1>

<h2>Grade</h2>

<p>
This option can be set to <strong>No grade</strong> if the forum is not 
assessed.
</p>

<p>
If the forum is assessed, setting this option determines how the post ratings
are combined to obtain a grade for the forum. Grades use the same scale as 
ratings: if ratings are from 0-5, then a student's grade for the forum also 
ranges from 0-5. 
</p>

<p>
In considering the following options, the same example situation is used.
User A has made two posts. One of these has been rated twice: a 3 by user B, 
and a 1 by user C. The other has been rated only once: a 5 by user B. The
rating scale is 0-5.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Average of ratings</strong> - all ratings for all posts by a
student are averaged. The mean rating is their grade. Student A scores 3 (1+3+5/3).</li>
<li><strong>Count of ratings</strong> - a student scores 1 point for each rating
rated (regardless of the rating itself), up to the maximum allowed by the
scale. Student A scores 3 because there are 3 ratings.</li>
<li><strong>Maximum rating</strong> - a student's score is equal to the highest
rating they have received. Student A scores 5.</li>
<li><strong>Minimum rating</strong> - a student's score is equal to the lowest
rating they have received. Student A scores 1.</li>
<li><strong>Sum of ratings</strong> - a student's score is equal to the sum of
all ratings they have received. Student A scores 5; it would have been 9, but
the score is limited to the size of the scale in use.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Most of these options make more sense when only teachers are allowed to rate
posts, and when they do so in a specific way. For example, the 'sum of ratings'
option could be used to assess total contribution to a forum:
</p>

<blockquote>A maximum score of 10 is chosen as the scale. The teacher 
rates each post as 0 if it is not useful, 1 if it is useful, or 2 if it is 
exemplary - even though the system provides options 3-10 as well, they do not 
use these. In this way, a student has to make a significant number of posts in
order to obtain the maximum 10 points.</blockquote>
