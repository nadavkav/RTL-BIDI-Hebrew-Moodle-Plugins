<h1>ForumNG</h1>

<h2>Enable ratings</h2>

<p>
If enabled, forum posts can be given ratings, either numeric (0-N) or using 
custom textual scales defined in Moodle settings. Numeric ratings are displayed
as stars if the range is 0-5 or less.
</p>

<p>
Even if you enable ratings, the capabilities system controls who is allowed to 
rate posts and who is allowed to see the ratings. By default, students cannot 
rate posts, and cannot see ratings except on their own posts.  
</p>

<p>
If enabled, multiple people can rate a single post. The displayed rating for
a post is the average (mean) of these ratings.	
</p>

<p>
There are three common use cases for the rating system:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Teachers rate posts for assessment purposes. The ratings might be visible
to the student being assessed, or might be entirely hidden.
(See <a href="grading.html">Grading</a> setting.)</li>
<li>Teachers rate posts to indicate when students make an important (or
unhelpful) contribution to the discussion.</li>
<li>Students rate each others' posts to 
<span style="text-decoration:line-through">start flame wars</span> help improve
the quality of discussion.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The three capabilities involved in the rating system might be set differently
for each of these cases. They are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>mod/forumng:rate - Able to rate posts.</li>
<li>mod/forumng:viewrating - Able to view the rating of your own posts.
(By default, students have this capability.)</li>
<li>mod/forumng:viewanyrating - Able to view the rating of all posts.</li>
</ul>
