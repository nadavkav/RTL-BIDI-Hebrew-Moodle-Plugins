<h1>ForumNG</h1>

<h2>Subscription</h2>

<p>
Four subscription options are available for forums:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Everyone can choose to be subscribed</strong> - everyone who can
view discussions in the forum is allowed to subscribe to it if they choose.</li>
<li><strong>Force everyone to be subscribed</strong> - all users with the
relevant <em>subscribe roles</em> are automatically subscribed to the forum and
cannot unsubscribe.</li>
<li><strong>Everyone is initially subscribed</strong> - users in <em>subscribe 
roles</em> are automatically added to the forum when they receive those roles,
but may unsubscribe later if they choose.</li>
<li><strong>Subscription is not permitted</strong> - email subscription is
unavailable for this forum.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The <em>subscribe roles</em> list is a system option. Ordinarily this would
include roles which are a core part of a course (such as students) but not
roles which are used for management purposes (such as administrators).
</p>

<p>
Subscriptions stop automatically if the user is no longer allowed to view
discussions in the forum (for example, if they are no longer a member of
the course).
</p>

<p>
This option can be disabled at site level in the system settings. If the option
is fixed in system settings, then all forums receive the same setting. If the
option is not fixed, then it can be changed on each individual forum.
