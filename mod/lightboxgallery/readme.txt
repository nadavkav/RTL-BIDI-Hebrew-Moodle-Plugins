Moodle Lightbox Gallery v2.01 (12th November 08)

 * ABOUT *

This resource allows you to create 'Lightbox' enabled image galleries within your Moodle course. The
Lightbox system is a set of scripts than can be used to apply nice effects to image galleries - more
info can be found at http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/

As a course teacher, you are able to create, edit and delete galleries. The main configuration option
involves telling Moodle which directory contains the images you want to include in the gallery. Small
thumbnails will then be generated, which are used for the thumbnail view of the gallery.

Clicking on any of the thumbnails brings that image into focus, and allows you to scroll through the
gallery at your leisure. Using the Lightbox scripts creates nice transition effects when loading and
scrolling through the images.

This version includes numerous changed, including (but not limited to!)...

 * Automatically resizing images on upload and for screens
 * RSS feed support
 * Allow users to add images to galleries
 * Tagging and searching images

This plugin was designed for Moodle version 1.9 and upwards

 * INSTALLATION / UPGRADING *

For installation/upgrading instructions, see the file install.txt in this archive. After installation
you'll find an extra item on your resources menu when editing a page. In an English install of Moodle
it will be named 'Add a lightbox gallery', this could differ for other languages.
