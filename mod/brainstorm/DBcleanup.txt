Using Moodle since 1.6 the installation of older Brainstrom versions
fails. Do not try to overwrite such installation before cleaning up
the Database using the following instructions:

1. Delete all Tables named prefix_brainstom* in your moodle Database

brainstorm
brainstorm_responses
brainstorm_categories



2. Delete all entries in the table "prefix_log_display" where
"module" has value "brainstorm" in your moodle database.



Now your Database ist prepared for the new version of the brainstorm
activity module.
