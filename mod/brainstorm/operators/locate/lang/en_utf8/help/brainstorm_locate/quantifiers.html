<p><b>Parameter:</b> Quantifiers</p>

<p>The 2D cartography principle is to locate ideas on a map using two more or less independant quantifiers. These quantifying values may be issued from a measurement, or might have been given as estimation by participants.</p>

<p>These parameters allow you to name the quantifier used for both dimensions of the map.</p>
