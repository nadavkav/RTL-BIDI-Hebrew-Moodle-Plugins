<p><img src="<?php echo "{$CFG->wwwroot}/mod/brainstorm/operators/{$operator}/pix/enabled.gif" ?>" /></p>
<p><b>Parameter:</b> Maximum number of ideas left</p>

<p>This parameter allows forcing participants to keep a certain amount of ideas from the source, thus making mandatory to select sufficiant ideas to eliminate to comply with the constraint.</p>

<p>If selecting ideas to delete seems being a problem for participants, the "pair comparison procedure" might be tried to arbitrate the filtering decision.</p>
