<h2>Operator: map of  of associations</h2>

<p><b>Parameter:</b> Allow checking cycles</p>

<p>When a set of elements are related, such relations may form cycles at first order (an element is self-related), second order, third order, etc.</p>

<p>When this mapping denotes "cause to effet" relationships, analyst can even assume there might be a "system" (Cf. Ludwig von Bertallanffy : General theory of systems ; Edgar Morin : Method). Searching cycles in an association map is a way to identify the eventual presence of such a system.</p>
