Drag and Drop ChangeLog

2008-06-05 Version 2008060502 (by Harry Winkelmann, Jean-Michel Védrine, Andreas Grabs)
* We have fully qualified URIs in all scripts.
* Including the dragdrop yui libs in the dragdropshow.tpl template by using
  a new function get_view_tpl_yui_libs() in dragdrop.php.
  - We are waiting until the YAHOO.util.Event.onDOMReady() event.
  - Afterwards we create and initialize the GapImages.
  - This is much better than tha ugly document.write method of javascript in script.js
* Deleted script.js at all. We don't need it anymore.
* Added new Databasefield for placing the mediafiles below or right beside the background.
* Added import/export functionality.

2008-06-05 Version 2008060501 (by Harry Winkelmann)
* Added new Databasefield for arranging the mediafiles in a grid.
  You now can select if all media is in one row or one or several columns.
* All javascript rewrite to make it compatible with moodles yui libs (version 2.3).
* New javascript methods for arranging the medias and hotspots.
  - Media moves back to startposition if dropped on invalid target.
  - Hotspots are moved AND RESIZED via drag and drop webinterface (yui libs version 2.5.2).
* Plugin installs and upgrades automatically.
  No codechanges in any moodle libs are necessary.
* Added new function get_arrange_tpl_yui_libs() in dragdrop.php for getting the htmltext
  which includes the 2.5.2 yui libs in the dragdroparrange.tpl template.
  - this function should notice when the moodle yui libs are available and take them.
* Complete rewrite of the view (dragdropshow.tpl) and arrange (dragdroparrange.tpl) templates.
* Deleted a lot of original code in dragdrop.php that was responsible for the old
  javascript implementation. Hopefully not too much...
* Including the dragdrop yui libs in the dragdropshow.tpl template by using the 
  document.write method of javascript in the script.js file. 
  This is a little bit ugly but I didn't know a better way.
* Added some translation strings and translated them also to german language.
* Added some code for workaround for bug (typo) in /question/format/qti2/qt_common.php
