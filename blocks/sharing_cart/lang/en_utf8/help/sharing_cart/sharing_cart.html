<h1>Sharing Cart</h1>

<p>version 1.9, release 5 - 2009.04.24</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>The Sharing Cart is a block that enables sharing of Moodle content (resources, activities) between
multiple courses on your site.  You can share among teachers or among your own courses.
It copies and moves single course items without user data &mdash; similar to the &ldquo;Import&rdquo;
function in Course Administration.  Items can be collected and saved on the Sharing Cart indefinitely,
serving as a library of frequently used course items available for duplication.
It is viewable only by teachers, course creators and administrators.
It requires Moodle version 1.9 and works with Topic, Weekly and Project course formats.</p>

<h2>Operation</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Turning On and Off</dt>
	<dd>With editing on, add the Sharing Cart block from the block menu.
		After adding the Sharing Cart block, you will notice the block stays "on" and follows you
		wherever you roam courses across a site.
		Click the "X" icon to turn "off" the Sharing Cart, although the contents of the Sharing Cart
		will remain there when you turn it on again.</dd>
<dt>Copying to the Sharing Cart</dt>
	<dd>You will notice a small "Copy to Sharing Cart" icon which appears after each
		resource or activity in the center column of a Moodle course.
		Click on that icon to send a copy of that resource/activity into the Sharing Cart.
		User data will be removed, only the activity itself will be cloned.</dd>
<dt>Copying from the Sharing Cart</dt>
	<dd>Click "Copy to course" icon in Sharing Cart, then the target markers appear on each section.
		You can select one of them to complete the copying, or "Cancel" which is above those.</dd>
<dt>Making folders inside the Sharing Cart</dt>
	<dd>Click the "Move into folder" icon on a course content item and an input box will appear
		if there is no folder.  Input the name of the target folder there.
		To move an item into an existing folder, click on the "Move into folder" icon,
		then a drop-down list appears, and select the target folder.
		If you click the "Edit" icon, you will replace the drop-down list with an input box.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Roles</h2>

<p>Generally, the Sharing Cart will duplicate any activity in any course that a teacher has access to.
However, Quiz questions have another set of permissions independent of site roles.
Therefore, we recommend if you wish to share questions, make the following changes:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Add a new role &mdash; Question Creator:
		Make this role in Site Admin &gt;&gt; Users &gt;&gt; Permissions &gt;&gt; Define roles,
		and assign all teachers to this role (in addition to other roles they already have).
		This role should be given at least the following rights (set permissions to "Allow")
		under "Course":
		<ul>
			<li>Manage Activities</li>
			<li>Manage Files</li>
			<li>Add new questions</li>
			<li>Edit all questions</li>
			<li>Edit question categories</li>
			<li>Move all questions</li>
			<li>Use all questions</li>
			<li>View all questions
		</ul></li>
	<li>Set questions to System Question Category:  If you set questions to course or activity
		level categories, you may not be able to share them.</li>
</ol>
