* Removed combination of NOTNULL="false" and DEFAULT="0"
* Removed nonstandard code instead of addslashes at import
* Changed directory for files to moodledata/exabis_eportfolio

2007-11-29 Version 2.03
* Changed name of language-file. bookmark.php is now exabisportfolio.php
* Cleaned up the code
* Removed all PARAM_RAW (except in one case where I do a manual check)
* Rewrote SQL for both MySQL and PostgreSQL (use of XMLDB, applied rules for SQL)
* Removed all global variables except the ones defined from Moodle
* Changed directory portfolio/ to eportfolio/
* Added $CFG->dirroot before require_once, require, include, include_once and before links.
* Removed bug: when deleting a categorie the entries weren't deleted.
* Set the Import-Capabilitiy default to off because the import may be a security risk.

2007-11-12 Version 2.02
* Removed bug when exporting external portfolios (comment-column was not created when you didn't update the plugin)
* When sharing a portfolio entry your own name is now shown.
* Problem with not finding the mimeinfo()-function (white page when editing a file portfolio entry)
* Added capability system. Comment: The Exabis E-Portfolio-rights have to be set globally (Assign global roles).
  Comment: the capability shareextern needs shareintern. You can only share extern if both shareintern and shareextern are set.
           allowposts is used to prevents posts on other (shared) bookmarks. You can always post on your own bookmark.
* Changed directory structure: put all the code inside eportfolio/. You can delete the direcotries bookmark/ and portfolio_export/ that were needed in previous installations. Please delete them *after* installing the new version.
* Removed direcory files/ and the file inside (mimetypes.php) because moodle is capable of the function mimetypes(). This file is not needed any more.
* Changes place where the exported SCORM-files (.zip) are saved. Put that back into the course-directories because elsewhere they would not be accessable with file.php.
* Comment: Didn't change place where the files of the bookmark are saved:
  Advantages:
    - Files are accessible now
    - This version is compatible with previous versions <= 2.01
  Disadvantage:
    - When a course is deleted the portfolio-files that were uploaded within this course are also deleted.
  Unfortunately there is no other way to implement this at the moment.
  The whole thing is a limitation of moodle that files can only be accessed within course-directories (with file.php).
  I heard of plans to solve this problems in future moodle versions. If anyone knows a better solution please tell me :)
* Changed location of images to eportfolio/pix because there were problems one some installations.

2007-08-05 Version 2.01
* Added require_login at the external portfolio. Guest user is allowed to, so if you want that a user who hasn't a login is automatically logged in as guest you have to set $CFG->autologinguests to 1
* Fixed problems with external links (the url was preceded with $CFG->wwwroot)
* Fixed breadcrumbs at import/export
* Added some language strings and removed hardcoded strings.
* Removed bug that the bookmark entries were not shown anymore when the course was deleted.
* Added column for Course name at the moodle-intern import.

2007-07-24 Version 2.00
* Added pix\i\desc.gif because in Moodle 1.8 this image is missing.
* Minor changes in nearly all files (e.g. replaces <br> with <br />)
* UI changes in view* and share* - files
* Partially reprogramming of view* and shar* - files

* Added comment-function  to all files, external links and notes when the user is viewing them (removed direct linking to files or links)
* changed most of the forms to formslib
* Block should not be shown on the start page of moodle - the paths were incorrect there. You should see the Block only when a course is selected.
